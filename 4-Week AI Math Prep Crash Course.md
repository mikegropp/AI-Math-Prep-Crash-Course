# 4-Week AI Math Prep Crash Course

This 20-hour crash course to take someone from absolute basic math to an advanced enough level to jump into AI. Precalculus -> Linear Algebra -> Calculus -> Statistics.

This is not an exhaustive guide nor is it meant to be followed exactly. I plan to fast forward and skip over most precalculus, but it's here for completeness of topics.

Finally, this is a rough curriculum I generated with Grok 4. It's not designed to be perfect, just helpful.
